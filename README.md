# BJJFlow
Started this around 2015 as notes from training and was trying to use it to sort out a gameplan. 

Used to work fine but most browsers are blocking hta now.
Standing is the starting spot, then you can move through via hyperlinks.
Run it all from the same directory/folder with the images folder under it.

Plan was to have it as an app with an embedded database but it never got that far.
